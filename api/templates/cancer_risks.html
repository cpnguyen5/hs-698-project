            <h3>Age</h3>
            <p id="title">The distribution of cancer prevalence is explored across each age group of the CMS dataset.</p>
            <ul class="list">
                <li>The median for the number of beneficiaries with cancer is approximately uniform across all age groups.</li>
                <li>Age groups <strong>65-74</strong> and <strong>75-84</strong> demonstrate higher variation as well as
                    a larger interquartile range. This may indicate that these groups have a higher distribution for
                    higher prevalence of cancer.Additionally, these groups have higher whisker values/bounds.</li>
                <li>Age groups <strong><65</strong> and <strong>>84</strong> have a smaller interquartile range, suggesting
                    that the prevalence values are in more agreement or consistent within these groups.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Race</h3>
            <p id="title">The distribution of cancer prevalence is explored across each race/ethnicity group.</p>
            <ul class="list">
                <li><strong>Non-hispanic White</strong> beneficiaries have an exceptionally larger interquartile range
                    and upper whisker bound, indicating a higher variation of cancer prevalence amongst CMS beneficiaries
                    of this racial background.</li>
                <li>The other racial groups have lower distributions and hence, prevalence of cancer. The lower
                    interquartile range (shorter box) suggests the prevalence of cancer is more consistent amongst
                    these groups.</li>
                <li><strong>Note: </strong>The dataset is limited due its lack of diversity with its surveyed population
                    consisting primarily of white beneficiaries.</li>

        <div class="container">
            <p id="title">The supplementary Big Cities Health Coalition dataset is used to examined the mortality rate of cancer in each
                major metropolitan. The mortality rates will provide a more in-depth understanding of the effects of cancer
                in the community.</p>
            <p id="title"><strong>Note: </strong> The mortality rates are reported <strong>per 100,000 people</strong>. The dataset
                is limited to only surveying large cities and the following cancer types and respective ICD10 codes: </p>
            <ul class="list">
                <li><strong>C00-C07</strong>: all cancers</li>

            <ul class="list">
                <li>The Big Cities Health Coalition dataset shows that <strong>African Americans</strong> have higher
                    mortality rates as a result of cancer in the big cities. <strong>White Americans</strong> are
                    consistently second in leading for mortality rates.</li>
                <li><strong>Asians & Pacific Islanders</strong> and <strong>Hispanics</strong> are surveyed to have
                    significantly lower mortality rates as a result of cancer in the big cities.</li>
                <li>The spikes in mortality rates as a result of cancer for Native Americans and Other races may be due
                    to their lack of representation in the previous surveyed years.</li>
