            <li>There is a positive, right-skewed distribution for the number of unique HCPCS services and procedures
                provided per provider under the Medicaid and Medicare programs, suggesting that the mean is larger than

                values are <strong>{{ median }}</strong> and <strong>{{ mode }}</strong>, respectively. This indicates
                that {{ mode }} unique services was more frequently ordered by the providers under CMS.</li>

                relationships. Specifically, the plot depicts the strength of correlation between the type of CMS costs
                and number of services under the Medicaid & Medicare programs. The Pearson Coefficient was calculated to
                measure linear correlation between 2 variables of numeric value and is measured in the interval [-1, 1].
